/single           - route to single handler
/path/*           - all routes under /path/*
/path/subpath/*   - more specific than /path/* so matches
/path/*.txt       - more specific than /path/* so matches
/path/{name}/*    - With jersey style capturing, more specific 
                    than /path/* but less specific than /path/subpath/*
/path/{name}/woot - More specific than /path/{name}/*

           branches containing nodes

   root -- single
        `- path ---- subpath -- *
                `--- *.txt
                `--- {name} -- woot
                            `- * 

Algorithm:
  - Split path on /
  - Check specific path (use hash table)
  - Check file patterns (order not specified)
  - Check captured
