/single           - route to single handler
/path/*           - all routes under /path/*
/path/subpath/*   - more specific than /path/* so matches
/path/*.txt       - more specific than /path/* so matches
/path/{name}/*    - With jersey style capturing, more specific 
                    than /path/* but less specific than /path/subpath/*
/path/{name}/woot - More specific than /path/{name}/*

           branches containing nodes

Search Algorithm:
  - Split path on /
  - Check specific path (use hash table)
  - Check file patterns (order not specified)
  - Check captured 

Insert Algorithm
  - Spit path on /
  - Foreach component of the path
     - If component exists insert into existing
     - If component does not exist, insert new
